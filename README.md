# Reprogramming Your Mind

Your mind comes with a programming language. Learn how to reprogram yourself.

This repo contains scripts for programming your mind.

I created this repo when preparing a presentation about Mindfulness for Android app developers. It will be very interesting to talk to programmers about programming your mind. 

I don't see humans as computers, not at all, but I see how clearly we are programmed. By parents, schools, friends, work, society, news, media, film, books, and much more. It is just that we often are unaware of this. 

Computer programmers are aware of programming machines, now we can also become aware of our own programming. Then we can alter what we don't want by reprogramming ourselves.
