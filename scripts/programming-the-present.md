# Programming the physical present

This is a way to reprogram your state of mind by projecting what you want to have into the physical present. Replace "calm" with the quality you wish to have. It can be joy, happiness, bliss, lightness. (It you wish stability, project it onto the ground rather than into the air, because the air being stable sounds a bit strange.)

- I am conscious
- I am am aware
- I am aware of the feeling of calm
- My body is experiencing the feeling of calm
- The room is calm
- The people in the room are calm
- The air is calm
- On each inbreath calm is flowing into my body
- On each outbreath calm is filling the room
- I am the calm that experiences the present now
