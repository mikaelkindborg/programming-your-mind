# Mindfulness script for awareness of the physical present

Say to yourself:

- I am conscious
- I am aware of the time of the day
- I am aware of where I am
- I exist here and now
- I am aware of my body
- I am aware of my feet
- I am aware of the ground
- I feel the contact between my feet and the ground
- I am aware of the stability of the ground
- I am aware of the air that surrounds me
- Air is flowing into and out of my body
- I am aware of my breath
- My breath is real
- The air is real
- The ground is real
- My body is real
- I exist in this place, in this moment
- My existence is real
- I am doing a mindfulness practice
